Airways Reservation System
Objective:
This software was build to provide assistance for the purpose of reserving tickets, or cancelling a reserved ticket, as well as rescheduling tickets. Since the information will be centralised so it can be easily updated in case of any changes to flight schedule. This minimises the need of help lines and customer support even at any locations. Thus it can help in minimizing the need for manual work.
							This system has been developed to help passengers in reserving their tickets online, access information about reserved passengers and passengers on waiting, cancel a booked ticket, and even reschedule a ticket. The main disadvantage of a manual system is eradicated in this software, i.e., the introduction of an error due to manual negligence.
Existing System:
Manual systems are more prone to error. Hence many a times they are unreliable. In cases of any changes in the flight schedule or cancellation of any flight, if the changes are not reciprocated to the passengers on time it causes a lot of inconvenience and this affects the reliability of the airlines as well. Any discrepancy may cause a lot of chaos and trouble to the airlines as well as passengers.
Proposed System:
The airways reservation system provides passengers with an online means of booking a flight ticket as well as cancellation of a previously booked ticket. A passenger can also reschedule a ticket as per convenience and look up if there are seats available in the questioned flight or not. The passengers can stay updated with the flight information. This provides a lot of ease to the passengers as well as the airlines.
